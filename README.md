# Horesion

## Description
In this  project, I added nav links to make the website more accessible as well as inlcuding alt tags when viewing the icon and image elements. I altered the structure of the HTML files to ensure that the logical structure is easy to understand at just a glance for fellow developers. I also made sure that my heading attributes fall in a sequential order while also following a logical structure independent of styling and positioning. I changed the title from 'website' to 'Horesion' to make it more concise. Below, I have attached screenshots of both my README.md file and my webapage respectivley.
