# html_horesion

## Description

In this  project, I created nav links to make the website more accessible as well as inlcuding alt tags for images when viewing the icon and image elements. I altered the structure of th HTML files to ensure that the logiacal structure is easy to understand at a glance for fellow developers. I also made sure that my heading attributes fall in a sequential order while also following a logial structure independent of styling and positioning. I changed the title from 'website' to 'Horesion' to make it much more concise. Below, I have attached screenshots of both my README.md file and my webapage respectivley.
